std::vector<bool> vec; // ...some operations... if (vec[i]) { // ... } This code might cause undefined behavior if the index i is out of bounds.  While accessing elements using vec[i] might seem straightforward, std::vector<bool> is a specialized container that doesn't store bools as individual bits. It uses bit manipulation for memory efficiency, which changes how indexing operates. This means that exceeding the bounds isn't always caught like with a normal vector.
